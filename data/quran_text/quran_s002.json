So he should write (i.e., meet the requirements of documentation with utmost honesty, in accordance with Islamic law).

And get two witnesses out of your own men. But if two men are not available, then a man and two women: (they) should be from amongst those whom you like as witnesses (i.e., consider trustworthy), so that if either of the two women forgets, the other may remind her. And the witnesses should not refuse whenever they are called (for evidence). And do not be weary of writing it down for its term, whether the transaction is small or large. This documentation by you is more just in the sight of Allah, and makes evidence more solid and nearer to keeping you from doubt, except that if transactions are hand-to-hand which you carry out amongst yourselves, then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down. And take witnesses whenever you bargain amongst yourselves. And let no harm be done to either the scribe or the witness, but if you do so, it will be sheer disobedience on your part. And keep fearing Allah.
